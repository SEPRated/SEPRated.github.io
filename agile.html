				<h1>Open Plan Programming</h1>
				
					<br>
				
				<h2>What is it?</h2>
				
					<p>Open plan programming or OPP for brevity, is an implementation methodology developed by our team to improve productivity 
					while maintaining quality. The team conducts implementation within the same environment and in close proximity,with each member 
					responsible for their own unique tasks (these tasks are undertaken in unique development branches). Discussions and brainstorming  
					is encouraged, this has improved the quality of the code and helped support inexperienced members by exposing them to the thought 
					processes of more skilled members. Both experienced and inexperienced members are free to ask for advice and assistance when dealing 
					with problems and critical implementation issues (such as the best use of data structures), this also allows each member to be aware of 
					the current progression of development and provides everyone with information regarding the structure of the project - meaning members can 
					quickly adapt and assist in the development of issues that were not assigned to them.</p>
		
					<br>
				
				<h2>Why are we using it?</h2>
				
					<p>Following the phase 2 of the project and early phase 3 the team raised concerns regarding the progress of development whilst using pair 
					programming. Despite the fact that all team members agreed that the quality of code had improved, the breadth of development was adversely 
					affected. Through developing in an open plan environment with individual deliverables, we have improved our development breadth whilst keeping 
					the advantages of developing in pairs (that being reduced stress and less erroneous code). This open environment also encourages inexperienced 
					members to engage with the team and seek guidance, in addition this it promotes teamwork and the development/strengthening of positive relations. </p>
